\Comment{What is the concrete problem statement you are solving? Please state this clearly in the introduction.}

   Modern computing needs have grown to require the execution of larger and more complex tasks, which require more storage and computational power than ever before.  Cloud computing has emerged as both a topic in research and industry, and strives to provide the best platform for these tasks given a set of resources to run them on.  Cloud computing is closely tied with its roots in distributed and grid computing systems and has significant overlap with them.  

  Eucalyptus is a popular cloud computing system, which allows for a transparent deployment of virtual machines (VMs) across a large variety of systems (usually in the form of a cluster or set of clusters) and also provides a consistent interface to access these systems.  From the perspective of Eucalyptus, the contents of an individual VM is seen only as a black box.  Despite this limited knowledge, Eucalyptus is tasked with scheduling these VMs with some level of optimality.  Finding a good configuration of these VMs is critical to achieving high utilization of the systems resources or consuming less power.  Eucalyptus itself has no control over when new VMs are requested and it also has no way to predict when they will be shut down (and removed from the system).  Eucalyptus uses a scheduler to assign VMs to specific computers, which has three different modes: a greedy scheduler, which places the VM in the first available computer it can find, a round-robin scheduler, which attempts to balance the load across machines by distributing the VMs between the computers in a cluster, and a power-saving mode, which uses the greedy scheduler for allocation, but also looks at usage thresholds and attempts to power down machines.

  Although Eucalyptus goes a long way in the way of providing transparent deployment and management, its use of a static scheduler is limited in its ability.  VMs can run for days, weeks, months, or years.  Additionally, these VMs can stress or saturate none or all of the resources provided to them.  Eucalyptus (or any other VM management system) has only a limited view of the VMs, and cannot be expected to know details of their execution or duration.  As new VMs are added and removed or their execution patterns change, the configuration in which Eucalyptus placed the VMs will quickly diverge from an optimal configuration.

For example, if there are 4 VMs to be scheduled across two machines, Eucalyptus will distribute them across these machines in a reasonable fashion.  With the round-robin scheduler, it would likely end up with 2 VMs on each of the two machines.  After this, it has no ability to change the system.  Even without the addition of new VMs or the removal of existing VMs, there are many ways in which this is non-optimal.  If the 2 VMs on the first machine has little to no CPU load and the 2 VMs on the second machine are contending for CPU resources, it is obvious that this configuration could be improved.  More generally, the dynamic needs and changing availability of resources (CPU, disk, memory, network, etc) suggests that assignment of VM to nodes statically is fundamentally insufficient if we are to have an efficient cloud.

% TODO XXX KOALA: Motivate our design decisions at least partially here!  Suddenly we're talking about live migration and learning algorithms, what just happened?!
Furthermore, because Eucalyptus has no application-level knowledge of the tasks running on its instances, we cannot simply terminate the VM's and start them elsewhere, as this would be unacceptable in many use cases.  Instead, we need to be able to dynamically reallocate resources tranparent to the end-user (guest OS, network connections, etc).  One way to accomplish this is through the use of \emph{live migration}, the transfer of an instance from one node to another transparently.  We believe appropriate use of live migration techniques is a core part of a solution to achieving an optimal cloud configuration.

% Partial attempt at motivating why a dynamic learning algorithm would be suitable--what problem are we solving by including this in our system?
%Finally, systems such as Eucalyptus are very complicated and have very different and often dynamically changing needs and users.

%mostly stolen from the abstract, might want to diverge more
To address these issues, we present \emph{Koala}, an enhanced Eucalyptus system which uses live migration and a dynamic scheduler to greatly improve resource utilization within a cluster.  Utilizing the benefits provided from live migration, Koala's dynamic scheduler can make effective and reactive scheduling decisions that were not possible by the basic Eucalyptus system.  Additionally, Koala's use of learning algorithms allow it to optimize the configuration of the scheduler and make it robust to changing needs and demands on the cluster.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.  In the next Section, we discuss related work.  In Section~\ref{sec:background}, describe the various components of Eucalyptus.  Section~\ref{sec:design} presents the design of our system, and the implementation details are described in Section~\ref{sec:impl}.  The evaluation of Koala is presented in Section~\ref{sec:eval}, and concluding remarks are provided in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.% Wording is terrible :P
