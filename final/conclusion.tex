\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

As demonstrated in our evaluation, Koala can offer significant performance improvements over Eucalyptus when VMs in contention for CPU resources.  In the passes of the experiments which were run with the highest loads, Koala was able to more than halve the average task durations.    We have shown that a dynamic scheduler can significantly improve the performance of CPU-bound tasks running on a cloud, and 

Future work involves extending the performance monitoring implementation to encompass additional resource types.  Koala's ability to improve performance is only limited to CPU resources as a result of the current implementation.  With accurate and robust monitoring of memory, disk, and network usage, Koala would be able to extend many of same benefits to memory, disk, and network limited tasks.  Additionally, as these types of tasks are run together, a greater number of effective configurations become available to the scheduler.  As we believe a more heterogeneous set of tasks better models a realistic cloud workload, the application of learning algorithms in the scheduler will allow Koala to best determine the optimal configurations of machines.
