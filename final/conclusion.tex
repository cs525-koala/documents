\section{Conclusion}

As we have shown, Koala can offer significant performance improvements over Eucalyptus when VMs in contention for CPU resources.  In the passes of the experiment with the highest loads, Koala was able to reduce the average .  Koala's ability to improve performance is only limited to CPU resources as a result of the current implementation.  With accurate and robust monitoring of memory and network usage, Koala would be able to extend the same benefits to memory and network limited tasks.
