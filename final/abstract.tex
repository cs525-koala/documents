As cloud computing continues to gain momentum, the infrastructure supporting
clouds continues to grow.  Many modern solutions make heavy use of
virtualization, not only to provide isolation between tasks, but also for
dividing hardware resources, and balancing machine utilization.  The Eucalyptus project has contributed a great deal of work to this area.  It is
one of the most common open source cloud computing systems, but presently only
has rudimentary scheduling policies that are only used to allocate VMs.  Given the dynamic needs of these VMs, we believe a static scheduler is not sufficient for providing high utilization.  We present \emph{Koala}, an enhanced Eucalyptus system which uses live 
migration and a dynamic, learning scheduler to greatly improve resource utilization within a cluster.  Utilizing the benefits provided from live migration, Koala's dynamic scheduler can make effective and reactive scheduling decisions that were previously not possible.  Additionally, Koala's use of learning algorithms allow it to get the most out of the scheduler and make it robust to changing needs and demands on the cluster.
%Wish we could back this up with evaluation results :/
