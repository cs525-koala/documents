\section{Evaluation}

Our current setup for Koala uses three computers.  The Eucalyptus Cloud Level Controller, Cluster Controller, Walrus Controller, and Storage Controller all are running on a CentOS 5 machine, with a 3GHz dual core processor and 4GB of ram.  We have two laptops running the Node Controllers on a Debian Squeeze machine, one with a 2.4GHz dual core processor and 4GB of ram, and the other with a 1.8GHz dual core processor and 2GB of ram.  The node controllers both run instances in QEMU with KVM support.
