As cloud computing continues to gain momentum, the infrastructure supporting
clouds continues to grow.  Many modern solutions make heavy use of
virtualization, not only to provide isolation between tasks, but also for
dividing hardware resources, and balancing machine utilization.  Eucalyptus is
an infrastructure that has contributed a great deal of work to this area.  It is
one of the most common open source cloud computing systems, but presently only
has rudimentary scheduling policies that are only used when an instance is
started.  We present \emph{Koala}, an enhanced system built on top of Eucalyptus
that uses live migration and a dynamic learning scheduler to greatly improve
resource utilization within a cluster.  Koala's dynamic scheduler makes use of
live migration to be more reactive and make much more effective scheduling
decisions than is previously possible in Eucalyptus, and also makes use of
learning algorithms to improve the scheduler dynamically in the presence of
changing conditions, workloads, and priorities.  Finally, Koala simplifies the
task of managing the cluster by exposing simple parameters to the administrator
(power consumption might be partially at odds with maximizing system
performance), further enabling the system to suit a particular environment.
Using all of these techniques, Koala provides an adaptable more efficient cloud
infrastructure.
%Wish we could back this up with evaluation results :/
