As cloud computing continues to gain momentum, the infrastructure supporting
clouds continues to grow.  Many modern solutions make heavy use of
virtualization, not only to provide isolation between tasks, but also for
dividing hardware resources, and balancing machine utilization.  Eucalyptus is
an infrastructure that has contributed a great deal of work to this area.  It is
one of the most common open source cloud computing systems, but presently only
has rudimentary scheduling policies that are only used when an instance is
started.  We present \emph{Koala}, an enhanced system built on top of Eucalyptus
that uses live migration and a dynamic learning scheduler to greatly improve
resource utilization within a cluster.  Koala's dynamic scheduler enables more
effective and reactive scheduling decisions than are presently possible, and
Koala's use of learning algorithms make it robust to the changing environmental
parameters.
%Wish we could back this up with evaluation results :/
