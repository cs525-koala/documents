\section{Background}
% If nothing else, describe eucalyptus in sufficient detail
% that we can refer to the components (cloud controller, etc)
% Maybe discuss the existing schedulers briefly?

Koala runs on Eucalyptus, a system which provides an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud interface.  This exposes virtualized hardware resources to the user, allowing them to build and manage the system as they see fit.  Eucalyptus is made of a hierarchy of controllers, including the Node Controllers (NCs), Cluster Controllers (CCs), Cloud Level Controller (CLC), Storage Controllers (SCs), and the Walrus Storage Controller.
