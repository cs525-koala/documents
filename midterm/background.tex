\section{Background}
% If nothing else, describe eucalyptus in sufficient detail
% that we can refer to the components (cloud controller, etc)
% Maybe discuss the existing schedulers briefly?

Koala runs on Eucalyptus, a system which provides an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud interface.  This exposes virtualized hardware resources to the user, allowing them to build and manage the system as they see fit.  Eucalyptus is made of a hierarchy of controllers, including the Node Controllers (NCs), Cluster Controllers (CCs), Cloud Level Controller (CLC), Storage Controllers (SCs), and the Walrus Storage Controller.  They communicate through web front ends, generated by Web Services Description Language (WSDL).

\subsection{Node Controller}
Node Controllers are at the bottom of the Eucalyptus hierarchy.  They are responsible for communicating with the hypervisor running on the node through the libvirt virtualization library.  Prior to our modifications and ignoring inter-VM communication, the Node Controllers communicate exclusively with their respective Cluster Controller.  They maintain the state of the VM and the host system's resources and communicate them back to the Cluster Controller.

\subsection{Cluster Controller}
Cluster Controllers are responsible for maintaining the state of a number of nodes.  The send heartbeats and query information about the instances and resources on each node and passes some of this information up to the CLC.  The CC is responsible for scheduling instances to the nodes it maintains.  It caches information on the nodes and instances in order to not have to poll all the nodes as it scales to larger numbers.
