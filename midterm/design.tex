\section{Design}
% Approach(es) planned to solving problems - initial thoughts will suffice.

For our project, we will modify the scheduler for eucalyptus to have adjustable
inputs.  Options such as prioritizing of VMs, number of VMs per server,
resources per VM, migration thresholds and many other options will be
modify-able.  We will then execute benchmarks and log the events related to the
scheduler.  We will then run a variety of benchmarks, likely including
cpu-limited, memory-limited, disk-limited, and network limited benchmarks.  We
will then analyze these event logs by utilizing data mining techniques.  We will
use this analysis to generate the scheduler.  We will compare the performance of
this scheduler to the unmodified scheduler of Eucalyptus.  Given sufficient
time, we will generate a system that logs evens during execution, which will
adjust the inputs on the fly, while attempting to maximize performance.
