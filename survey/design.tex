\section{Design}
For our project, we will modify the scheduler for eucalyptus to have variable thresholds.  Options such as prioritizing of vms, number of vms per server, resources per vm, migration thresholds and many other options will be modify-able.  We will then execute benchmarks and log the events related to the scheduler.  We will run cpu-limited, memory-limited, disk-limited, and network limited benchmarks.  We will then data-mine these event logs and generate a decision tree to set the options for the scheduler.  We compare the performance of this scheduler to the original scheduler of eucalyptus.
