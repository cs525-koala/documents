\section{Timeline}
March 7: Get a basic install of Eucalyptus up and running.
March 14: Have strong understanding of how scheduling works in Eucalyptus and begin work on the design and modifications to the scheduler
March 21: Have a working version of the adjustable scheduler which is ready to generate data.
March 28: Gather data with said scheduler.
April 4: Use analysis of data to determine optimal inputs to scheduler
April 11: Using what we have observed up to April 4th, rework scheduler
April 18: Gather new data and determine inputs for scheduler
May 2: Final Evaluation (comparing original scheduler to our own) and possibly explore an automated incremental version of this process which runs alongside Eucalyptus during execution.
