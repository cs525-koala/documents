\section{Proposed Timeline}
\begin{itemize*}
\item{March 7}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Get a basic install of Eucalyptus up and running.
\end{itemize*}

\item{March 14}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Have strong understanding of how scheduling works in Eucalyptus
  \item Begin work on the design and modifications to the scheduler
\end{itemize*}

\item{March 21}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Have a working version of the adjustable scheduler which is ready to
    generate data.
\end{itemize*}

\item{March 28}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Characterize various workloads and design experiments to simulate them
  \item Gather data with our scheduler on these workloads
\end{itemize*}

\item{April 18}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Analyze results of experiment
  \item Investigate how we can improve it with respect to data
  \item Implement various improvements and evaluate result
  \item Iterate and document the process
\end{itemize*}

\item{May 2}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Final Evaluation: (comparing original scheduler to our own)
  \item (Optional) Explore an automated version of this process and integrate
    with Eucalyptus.
\end{itemize*}
\end{itemize*}
