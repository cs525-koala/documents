\begin{abstract}
As cloud computing continues to gain momentum, the infrastructure supporting clouds continues to grow.  Many modern solutions make heavy use of virtualization, not only to provide isolation between tasks, but also for dividing hardware resources, and balancing machine utilization.  Eucalyptus is an infrastructure that has contributed a great deal of work to this area.  It is one of the most common open source cloud computing systems, and uses two simple scheduling algorithms, a greedy scheduling algorithm, and a round robin scheduling algorithm.  We feel both of these algorithms leave room for improvement, and we expect to demonstrate that with our scheduler.
