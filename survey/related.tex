%% HOW TO ORGANIZE?! We are writing ~2 pages of related work, and are going to

% For now, lets just talk about each paper and try to tie them together in the

%% Eucalyptus scheduler, talk about it here
Blah blah~\cite{Eucalyptus}.

%% Papers we read for class.
Researches from Microsoft built Quincy~\cite{Quincy}, which is a cloud
scheduling framework.  Quincy maps the task of job scheduling to a min-cost flow
problem in which they use various cost functions to represent data locality,
cost of killing a task, and more.

``Improving MapReduce performance in heterogeneous systems'' Zaharia~\cite{Zaharia}.

Mantri~\cite{Mantri}.

%% Zhao work on adaptive load-balancing.
A problem related to optimizing scheduling is that of load-balanacing.  Zhao, et
. all~\cite{Zhao} developed an adaptive load-balancing system algorithm
``COMPARE\_AND\_BALANCE''.
