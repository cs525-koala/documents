%% HOW TO ORGANIZE?! We are writing ~2 pages of related work, and are going to
% have at _least_ 15 references... We need to find a way to group them and
% present them in a somewhat connected manner.

% For now, lets just talk about each paper and try to tie them together in the
% next iteration.

%% Eucalyptus scheduler, talk about it here
The baseline of our work is the default set of schedulers contained in
Eucalyptus~\cite{Eucalyptus}.  Eucalyptus ships with two main schedulers: greedy
and round-robin.  Greedy will simply use the first available node that can run a
given job, and round-robin each time will find the \emph{next} suitable node.

%% Papers we read for class.
Researches from Microsoft built Quincy~\cite{Quincy}, which is a cloud
scheduling framework.  Quincy maps the task of job scheduling to a min-cost flow
problem in which they use various cost functions to represent data locality,
cost of killing a task, and more.

%% Zhao work on adaptive load-balancing.
A problem related to optimizing scheduling is that of load-balanacing.  Zhao, et
. all~\cite{Zhao} developed an adaptive load-balancing system algorithm
``COMPARE\_AND\_BALANCE''.
